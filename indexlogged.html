                        <h2>Here’s What Happens to Your Body During an Aerial Yoga Class</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        It is well-documented that I'm a huge fan of Savasana, the final resting pose at the end of yoga class. So when I heard that aerial yoga classes offer particularly relaxing Savasana sessions, I signed up for what I thought was a restorative class at Christopher Harrison's AntiGravity Fitness Lab in New York City. Gently rocking back and forth in a hammock? That's a Savasana lover's dream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the class started however, I quickly realized I'd accidentally registered for an open level session. In other words, I was going to have to do some pretty intimidating hanging-upside-down poses in order to earn that glorious Savasana. As someone who has never—not once, not even almost—done any kind of inversion in a regular yoga class, this was a big deal. Cue panic mode. Can I escape without the teacher noticing? I wondered frantically. (It was a six-person class, so that was a no.)

                    </header>
                    <p>
                        New to yoga and wondering what all the terms mean (from Utkatasana to Balasana) or what class etiquette you should be aware of? Or if you've been practicing for awhile, are you unsure if you'll ever be able to master some of the more challenging poses? Whether you're a newbie or have been Downward Dogging it for years, there's a lot to celebrate—and learn—about this ancient practice. From confidence-building moves to health benefits to must-follow Instagram feeds, here's some fresh motivation to strike a pose right now.
