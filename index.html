                            Hello, and welcome to my new website and blog. I’m hoping to make this an interactive place where readers can come to share their thoughts on my stories. You can let me know what you liked, what you didn’t, or what you might be interested in seeing in future series. Or you can share your thoughts on characters and how they’ve learned and grown over the course of a book. The most gratifying part of writing for me is hearing that my stories have interested or inspired readers in some way, so I’m looking forward to hearing any thoughts you’re willing to share. I’m a reader myself, and both my writing and reading provide a means of escape for me. Sometimes life can be confusing, tough, or just plain old boring. Stories help us break away from everyday life for a brief moment, and be part of another world. I hope the worlds of the bear shifters in my tales will entertain you and provide you with a reprieve from the ordinary. From this point forward, I’m going to try to share a brief blog post about each new release with you. I might discuss my own favorite parts of the book, or perhaps a bit of the back-story for how I found the inspiration for that particular work. I’m hoping to release the next book in the Ice Bear Shifters Series—Bearing the Black Ice—this coming weekend. So, be looking out for that, and for a blog post about the book.
